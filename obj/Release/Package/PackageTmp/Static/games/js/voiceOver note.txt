all games should be compatible with IOS (and other) voice-over programs.
the problem - voice-over does not allow clicking on random places on the screen,
which is a necessity in html5 games.

solution: the window is covered with <div> blocks in a table-like manner. 
each div is a link and has text in it - so the voice-over considers it clickable.
the player can then click anywhere on the screen and the client will see that
the div is clicked.

how it works:
~~~~~~~~~~~~
the game must have this row before the <script> part:
	<script src="voiceOver.js"></script>

now it should implement the following:
	var horCells = (number of columns);
	var verCells = (number of rows);
	
optional:
	fillTableWithText(divText,horCells);

this function will fill the cells with a given text, which is written in an array divText.
the function puts each element in the array in a different div, from left to right and from
top to bottom. the default text in the divs is "column X row Y".

click actions are implemented like this:
	function clickFunc(x,y)
	
when a div is clicked it calls this function implemented in the game with the coordinates
of the div.

that's it, good luck.
